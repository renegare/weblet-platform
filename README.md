# Weblet Platform Lib

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/renegare/weblet-platform.png?branch=0.1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/renegare/weblet-platform)

This project contains a base set of classes that can be used to create a API application.
It is a library and should be included as dependency and extended to fit your needs.

The real base is Silex*, and is essentially a preconfigured Silex app.
The aim of providing the lowest possible learning curve in order to get started.

However, do not let that limit how ambitious you want your project to be ;).

The aims of this library is provide the following features:

* OAuth2 compliant server
* Endpoint Service Locator
* Swagger-esque doc generation

*(This list is not complete and will grow as the need requires)*

\* Using Silex v1.2.x (will be upgrading to 2.0 once stable)

## Documentation ...

... is none existent. However, there is at least one test for each feature. If they
are too complicated to read then I possibly need to rewrite it. But don't be scared.
Take a look an when I have time documentation will be a priority!

## Usage

To use this library, include it as a dependency in your project via composer

```
composer require renegare\weblet-base:dev-master
```
*(!!! Please use an actual tagged version for production use as ```dev-master```
will potentially be updated without warning and contain bugs. !!!)*

Then create an instance or extend the class ```\Renegare\Weblet\Platform\Weblet```:

```
// Example index.php

/**
 * Pass the app name and configuration to the constructor
 * - No errors are thrown if any yaml file does not exist
 */
$app = new Renegare\Weblet\Platform\Weblet('weblet',
    __DIR__ . '/../app-constants.yml.dist',
    __DIR__ . '/../app-constants.yml',
    ['app.root' => dirname(__DIR__)] // required
);

// enable built in functionality
$app->enableSecurity();
$app->enableLogging();

// and away we go!
$app->run();

```

## Test

```
composer test
```
